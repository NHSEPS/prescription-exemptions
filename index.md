## Introduction ##

NHS Prescription Fraud is currently costing over £200 million a year. Patients are not clear what exemptions they are entitled to and how to obtain the required proof. The current paper system is open to error and checks are only carried out by the BSA once medication has been dispensed.

NHS Digital has been asked to provide an effective solution to ensure that exemptions from prescription charges are applied correctly prior to medication being dispensed. The solution will enable Dispensers to check a Patients’ active prescription status, resulting in exemptions being applied correctly prior to medication being dispensed, thereby reducing prescription fraud in England which currently stands at £237 million a year.
