## Requirements Trace ##

Evidence to demonstrate meeting these requirements is approved by NHS Digital Solution Assurance compliance team. A Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) derived from functional requirements is recommended for this.

  * [Requirement Traceability Matrix (XLS)](downloads/Prescription Exemption Checking Client RTM.xlsx)

## Test Evidence - Functional Requirements##

There are a set of acceptance criteria which should permit automated testing of the integration.  Evidence of successful test shall be provided to demonstrate compliance.

  * [Acceptance criteria](testing_acceptance_criteria.html)

## Witness Testing ##

Witness Testing shall be conducted but it will be limited to those changes that have a impact on Spine - namely the population and sending of the reimbursement Claim message.

## Test Evidence - Non Functional Requirements ##

Implementers should work with NHS Digital SA Non-Functional Assurance Team to ensure that their solution addresses the non-functional requirements. Evidence to demonstrate meeting these requirements must be approved by the SA Non Functional Assurance Team. Formal V&P and RFO testing is not required.
